# aether ELK Stack Case Study


### Amazon Web Services' infringement of copyright.
Amazon made the decision to offer Elasticsearch and Kibana products on their cloud platform directly as a service without collaborating with Elastic. This does not affect the end user, as the user just uses the end product, however, these products have taken 12 years for Elastic to develop. To have AWS obtain these and offer them to customers as a paid service without any profits going to elastic was considered to be an unethical use of their service. The first infringement of this unethical practice dates back to 2015.

### Elastic changes their license.
After a long period of time spent in court, AWS and Elastic settled their disputes and Elastic were able to change their license. 
The three key changes include:
1. It is not possible for third party company to provide Elasticsearch as a paid service.
2. No one can modify the license key functionality or modify features protected by license keys.
3. Strengthening the licensing and copyright notices of the service.

### Amazon's response
 With new restrictions in place, Amazon decided to create it's own service called Amazon OpenSearch. 
 This service offers a system enabling the end user to view large data volumes at scale and includes a data visualisation tool. 

### Reliability of the OpenSearch

Amazon Web Services (AWS) OpenSearch is a highly reliable and scalable search service that is designed to handle a large number of search queries and indexing requests. It is built on top of the same infrastructure that powers other AWS services, which are known in the industry for their high availability and durability. This is primarily due to the service level agreement AWS has with their customers, which promises 99.9% uptime for all their services.

### Trustworthiness of AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a widely used and trusted cloud computing platform. It is known for its reliability, security, and scalability. AWS has a number of security measures in place to protect customer data and ensure the integrity of its services. These measures include physical security, network security, and system security.
